# helsingborg-io-formdata

A repository for keeping track of all the forms that we construct for mitt-helsingborg. One form is stored in one json-file. The structure should be one folder per application area (i.e. one folder for Ekonomiskt Bist√•nd), and then sub-forms in appropriate subfolders. Try to group things so that it makes sense for us.

Currently the repository is 'dumb', but eventually we want to automate it with actions so that the master branch keeps the database updated, or something along these lines.
